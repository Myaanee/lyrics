# Lyrics

### Personal collection of lyric files I made over the years.
### They usually come as ASS Subtitles and or LRC Files.


### Folder structure is:
```
regular_songs/[YEAR]/[ALBUM NAME]/[TITLE].ass|lrc|jp.lrc
```

File formats are:
- ass
	- Regular subtitles, with Romaji and Japanese track if the song's Japanese
- lrc
	- Lyrics Format (for e.g Foobar2000), contains only Romaji if song's Japanese
- jp.lrc
	- Same as above but also contains the original Japanese

The translations and romanizations are **very** far from perfect, but feel free to PR fixes if you so desire.


Note: This repo only contains text-lyrics, no audio at all!
