# Lyrics

### Personal collection of lyric files I made over the years.
### They usually come as ASS Subtitles and or LRC Files.


### Folder structure is:
```
regular_songs/{YEAR}/{ALBUM NAME|ARTIST NAME}/[{TRACK_NUMBER}] {ARTIST} - {TITLE}.ass|lrc|jp.lrc
```

File formats are:
- ass
	- Regular subtitles, with Romaji and Japanese track if the song's Japanese
- raw.ass
	- Same as above, but without lead-in and kfx applied (for editing).
- lrc
	- Lyrics Format (for e.g Foobar2000), contains only Romaji if song's Japanese
- jp.lrc
	- Same as above but also contains the original Japanese

The translations and romanizations are **very** far from perfect, but feel free to PR fixes if you so desire.

Also note, since I do not speak this goofy language, there can be lyrics that are only partially translated or not at all, again, feel free to submit PRs.


Note: This repo only contains text-lyrics, no audio at all.
